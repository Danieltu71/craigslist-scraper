Craigslist Scraper

<u>Craigslist Scraper</u> is a scraping tool that overcomes advanced
anti-bot systems and helps you gather public data from Craigslist on any
scale you need. This guide will show you how to scrape Craigslist using
Oxylabsâ€™ <u>Scraper API</u>.

How it works

You can get Craigslist data by sending a request to our API with the
URLs you want to access and scrape. The API will return the HTML of any
public Craigslist page.

Python code example

The below code sample sends a request to our service, which uses a
headless browser to execute JavaScript and sends back the HTML of a
Craigslist page:

import requests
from pprint import pprint

```python
# Structure payload.
payload = {
   'source': 'universal',
   'url': 'https://berlin.craigslist.org/search/ela#search=1~gallery~0~0',
   'geo_location': 'Germany',
   'render': 'html'
}

# Get a response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('USERNAME', 'PASSWORD'), #Your credentials go here
    json=payload
)

# Instead of response with job status and results URL, this will return the
# JSON response with results.
pprint(response.json())
```

Visit the <u>documentation</u> to find more payload parameters and other
details.

Output sample

```python
{
  "results": [
    {
      "content": "<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>
      ...
      </script></body>\n</html>\n",
      "created_at": "2023-09-21 14:26:52",
      "updated_at": "2023-09-21 14:27:10",
      "page": 1,
      "url": "https://berlin.craigslist.org/search/ela#search=1~gallery~0~0",
      "job_id": "7110630468831163393",
      "status_code": 200
    }
  ]
}
```
